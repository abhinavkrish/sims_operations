The Operations Simulator (OpSim) delivers simulated observing schedules for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). The Simulated Survey Tools for Analysis and Reporting (SSTAR) is a set of metrics and analyses that can be run on the output of an OpSim run. The SSTAR produces intermediate output in ascii tables and images, followed by an assimilation of a selected set of the intermediate outputs into a single PDF report called the SSTAR Standard report. 

The metrics compiled in the SSTAR Standard report measure the performance of LSST with respect to: engineering parameters, such as the slew time between observations and the number of filter changes; observing parameters such as image quality and sky brightness; and science performance parameters such as the area of sky surveyed, the number of visits, the stacked depth of the images. 

The SSTAR outputs have been utilized in developing the LSST concept (telescope aperture, field of view), in the site survey (verifying performance with actual site conditions), and in engineering design (motor performance, detector specifications, etc).
