Queries which might be posed after a Simulation Run
===================================================


o.t. == overtime

Proposal/Target
===============
Data Collected:
	why selected (bonus enhancements satisfied, cadence satisfied)
	when selected (simtime)
	satisfying what proposals
	environmental specifics (field,filter,seeing,airmass,temp,...)
	time delay (exposure and instrument setup)

To Answer:
    What is:
	coverage for {all proposals, each proposal} o.t.
	order of Field selection o.t.
	# targets satisfying multiple proposals
	Science Proposal ranking of top target and Master Scheduler ranking 
		of selected target o.t.

Weather
=======
Data Collected: 
	seeing/transparency for each observation

To Answer:
    What is:
	the seeing  for {all Fields, each Field} o.t.
	# {adequate, good, bad} seeing hours
	# potential seeing hours 

Astronomical Sky
================
Data Collected:
	airmass at observation for target

To Answer:
    What is:
	airmass for observations for {all fields, each field} o.t.

Filter
========
Data Collected: 
	when mounted and for what reason (proposal/target, start of night)

To Answer:
    What is:
	filter use o.t.
	filter change (reposition or reload) and change penalty o.t.

Instrument
==========
Data Collected: 
	adjustment activity (focus, move, ...) and time delay 

To Answer:
    What is:
	device adjustment and time penalty for adjustment o.t.

Field
=====
Data Collected: 
	see target/proposal

To Answer:
    Overlay Field selection count {1 filter, any filter} over Field map 


Non-Observing Blocks
=====================
Data Collected: 
	when block initiated, elapsed time, simulation of what time block,
		?occurred during observing period?

To Answer:
    What is:
	% potential observable time lost due to {type of non-Science imaging} 	
		time


Observing Cycles
=================
Data Collected:
	TOD (time of Day) for startup of night's observing 
	TOD (time of Day) for end of night's observing
To Answer:
	?


Setup
======
Data Collected:
	all input files  (either CVS version # or actual text)
To Answer:
	what {cuts, bonuses) were used in {all proposals, each proposal}
	what  was weather model
	what proposals

Completion
===========
Data Collected:
	simulation restart checkpoint  (python 'pickling')
To Answer:
	continue simulation from where it left off.
