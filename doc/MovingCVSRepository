Moving the CVS Repository from Gumtree to Cronos 
================================================

Following is needed only if you want to continue working in an existing
CVS working directory after the CVS source repository has changed machines.
We are assuming that the actual source directory pathname remains the same no 
matter where it is moved.

Use the following scenario as a prototype to be tuned accordingly.



The following will convert your gumtree based source directory into a
cronos based directory.
                                                                                
You should:
1) install the file: fixit  (found below) onto your home account on cronos.

2) uncomment the line for "converting existing cronos working directory"
                                                                                
3) run the following command to change the CVS/Root in each source
    directory
                                                                                
            find . -name Root -exec ~/fixit {} \;
                                                                                
4) check that all Root files were altered:
        find . -name Root -exec cat {} \;
                                                                                
5) alter your cronos .cshrc definition for CVSROOT to be:
    setenv CVSROOT /data1/simulator/REPOSITORY
                                                                                
6) ensure that all your existing cronos windows update their CVSROOT alias
   Simplest way is to logout/login again.
                                                                                
You should now be able to 'cvs update' against the cronos CVS release
in order to check its functioning.
                                                                                
                                                                                
If you maintain a CVS directory on a secondary machine, then you need to do
a modified version of the above procedure.
                                                                                
1) change the 'gumtree' in your ~/.cshrc definition of CVSROOT to 'cronos'
                                                                                
2) move the 'fixit' routine over to your remote system and  uncomment the
   command to convert non-gumtree/cronos systems' working directories.
   Also comment-out the command for cronos/gumtree conversion.
   (It's obvious once you see the 4 line script.)
                                                                                
3) run the script as above on your remote system.
                                                                                


Script 'fixit':
===============
#!/bin/tcsh
mv $1 $1.sav
                                                                                
# Following for non-cronos and non-gumtree  CVS working directiories
#cat $1.sav | sed -e "s/gumtree/cronos/"  > $1
                                                                                
# Following for converting existing cronos working directory
#cat $1.sav | sed -e "s^.*:^^" > $1
 
# following to convert the original gumtree working directory
cat $1.sav | sed -e "s-^-:ext:robyn@cronos.tuc.noao.edu:-" > $1
