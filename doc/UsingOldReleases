Using a previous Production release
===================================

All Production releases are archived on ariadne:prodRelease/lsst_Prod-*.tgz .
Use them to recover an old software release.  The CVS repository is NOT 
tagged with respect to the Production releases.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Using MYSQL to directly access an old Release's DB Tables
-----------------------------------------------------------
If you're going to access the DB directly through MYSQL commands and do NOT 
need any of simulator codes (newextract.py, etc),  you can access the 
old release directly and not worry about other users being affected by your
use if you do the following.  First, create a new Database named the 
same as the old Release directory. Second, use the new database's name in the 
Mysql command line.  Then you are able to access the old release's db tables.
via the usual sql operations.

The account should be mysql:root since that account has the privileges to 
create new Databases. We usually setup the 'mysql:root' account with same 
pswd as for user: mysql:www.

# first, as mysql 'root' create a valid database of same name as 
#    old release's directory name
mysqladmin -u root -p create LSST_Prod-<version>
    <zxcvbnm>
# Now access the old release as the 'www' user
mysql -u www -p LSST_Prod-<version>
    <zxcvbnm>
    show tables;
    ...
    quit

NOTE: On completion, do NOT remove the DATABASE structure specially 
fabricated for the appropriately named DB tables.  The DB tables would
get garbage collected, if you did.

Accessing old Release's DB Tables through Simulator codes
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to use the matching software, then you need to break the current
links and reset them to the appropriate version.  You want to do this only
after you have coordinated with anyone else who might be using the Production
source and data tables.

cd $SRCROOT
rm lsst
ln -s lsst_Prod-<version> lsst
cd $DBDATA
rm LSST
ln -s LSST_Prod-<version> LSST

Now, you're ready to access the old DB Tables as you always have.

Remember to re-establish the links to the 'correct' version when you are
done with the old one.
