Making a movie from simulator/viz/newextract.py data

1) Run the simulator to collect the data. 
   Note the <sessionID> automatically assigned to the dataset on startup. 
        cd $LSSTROOT/simulator/src
        ./main.py >& run

2) Setup the newextract.py input file; name it <movieScript>
    a) determine the number of days in the simulation (<#SimDays>)
    b) decide how often you want a snapshot of the simulation (<interval>)
       The default is 0.5 days.
    c) use: makeMovieInput.py to generate the newextract.py movie-making script
        cd $LSSTROOT/simulator/viz
        ./makeMovieInput.py <#SimDays> <interval> >  <movieScript>

3) build the movie's frames
   This process displays each frame as it's built so run on a system with 
   a fast network connection.  Each frame will be loaded into the current
   directory; their names will be ordered lexicographically.
        cd $LSSTROOT/simulator/viz
        mkdir Movie
        cd Movie
        ../newextract <sessionID>  <  movieScript

## NOTE: We are no longer using mencoder to make movies (MM 12/18/08)
4) Convert the frames into a movie

    You must have MPlayer installed on your system.  If not, either install it
    or move the previously fabricated frames onto a system hosting 'MPlayer'.  
    Gumtree has it installed.

    Ensure the frames are in lexicographic order. The following 'ls' should
    display the frames so the numbers are monotonically increasing.
        ls *.png

    Run the movie maker to create the movie named: <movieName>.avi
        mencoder 'mf://*.png' -mf type=png:fps=10 -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=wmv2 -oac copy -o <movieName>.avi

5) Play the new movie
    mplayer <movieName>.avi
