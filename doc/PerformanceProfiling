...doc/PerformanceProfiling

This document shows how to create a performance profile


In order to generate profiling data, use the simulator command line 
argument '--profile'. The profiling information will be output 
to: 'ProfileData' over the course of the simulation.

Subsequent execution of the code: '.../src/LsstProfile.py' , will
generate a profiling report.  The user should modify the particulars
of 'LsstProfile.py' to reflect the report desired.

The user should ensure the simulation elapsed time is short in duration 
(1 week, if possible) since long runs generate extensive profiling output. 

Also, note that generating the final report is very slow; be patient.

An example:
   cronos% ./main.py --profile=yes
   cronos% ./LsstProfile.py  > Profile.output
