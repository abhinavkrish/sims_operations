Overview

The Operations Simulator (OpSim) is an application that simulates the field selection and image 
acquisition process of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) over the 10-year life of the 
planned survey.  
Each visit or image of a field in a particular filter is selected by combining science program requirements, the mechanics of the telescope design and the modelled environmental conditions. The output of the simulator is a detailed record of the telescope movements and a complete description of the observing conditions as well as the characteristics of each image.

A technical description of how the Operations Simulator works is described in this `SPIE paper <http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2056898>`_.

General information about the LSST Project and its science goals is located on
the `public LSST website <http://www.lsst.org>`_. Information and
datasets released to the Science Collaborations can be accessed at the 
`Operations Simulation Gateway <https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/SIM/Operations+Simulation+Gateway>`_.

Questions and comments should be directed to lsst-opsim@lsstcorp.org, and
a member of the OpSim Team will respond to your request.
