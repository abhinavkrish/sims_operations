Overview

The Operations Simulator (OpSim) is a tool that creates a simulated survey of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) given science driven requirements, a model of the telescope and its control system and models of weather and other environmental variables. The output of such a simulation is an "observations history", which is a record of times, pointings and record of associated environmental data throughout the simulated survey.

General information about the LSST Project and its science goals is located on the publically accessible website ``http://www.lsst.org``. Information and datasets released to the Science Collaborations can be accessed at ``http://www.lsstcorp.org/opsim/home``. The username is ''lsst'' and the password is ''3gigagpix!''.

Questions and comments should be directed to lsst-opsim@lsst.org. The appropriate team member will respond to your request.
