Overview
********

The Operations Simulator (OpSim) is a tool that creates a simulated survey of
the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) given science driven requirements, a
model of the telescope and its control system and models of weather and other
environmental variables. The output of such a simulation is an "observations
history", which is a record of times, pointings and record of associated
environmental data throughout the simulated survey.

General information about the LSST Project and its science goals is located on
the publicly accessible `website <http://www.lsst.org>`_. Information and
datasets released to the Science Collaborations can be accessed
`here <https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/SIM/Operations+%28Observatory%29+Simulation+Gateway>`_.

Questions and comments should be directed to lsst-opsim@lsstcorp.org. The
appropriate team member will respond to your request.
