Documentation assumptions/implementations
This handbook is a reference manual for the Operations Simulator (OpSim) – describing the code structure, its basic functionality and data output, as well as the tools available for analysis and reporting.
To meet the information dissemination needs of the OpSim Team and to serve the Science Collaborations, several portals have been created (Document-5474).

**Data Access Website** General information about the LSST Project and its science goals is located on the publically accessible website ttp://www.lsst.org. Information and datasets released to the Science Collaborations maybe accessed at ttp://www.lsstcorp.org/opsim/home. The username is “lsst” and the password is “3gigagpix!”.

**Docushare Workspace-15** Team project management materials are collected in this workspace and there is also a directory “Quick Reference Documents” which contains papers, slide presentations, and posters pertaining to the Operations Simulation Team effort. Users must have a Docushare username and password.

**Mantis** A bug tracking system has been set up to maintain reqests for enhancements to both the Operations Simulator (OpSim) and Simulated Survey Tools for Analysis and Reporting (SSTAR) codebases. There is also a catalog of runs that is automatically generated as simulations are executed, with features for commenting on a run’s status, purpose, and successful completion. Users must have a Mantis username and password.

**Science Wiki** The Science Wiki is a forum for the Science Collaboration members and requires a username and password. There is basic information and links to more detailed information on the Data Access Website as well as links to analysis tools at a website hosted by the University of Washington.

**Enterprise Architecture Server** The Enterprise Architecture (EA) Server is being used to make analysis workbooks that have been created by Tableau accessible to OpSim Team members who need access to a Microsoft Windows environment. A users Docushare username and password is required.

In §2 the structure of the code, the database, and the proposals are described, and in §3 details of the implementation of the functions are discussed. Section 4 describes the output of the simulation that is provided and how to access it, while §5 discusses the available tools for visualization, analysis, and reporting. Section 6 is a collection of result of studies that were done with the Simulator and is a resource for how the Simulator can be used to explore scheduling solutions to the 10-year survey problem.
Questions and comments should be directed to lsst-opsim@lsst.org. The appropriate team member will respond to your request.
