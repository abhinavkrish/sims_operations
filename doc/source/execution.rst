Running the Simulator 
********

Once the Simulator is installed on a machine, it may be run by reviewing and customizing values for the parameters defined 
in the configuration files, which are located in ``/lsst/opsim/conf`` and are described in the next section. Once this is done, the Simulator is started by changing directories to ``/lsst/opsim/src`` and running the folowing script ::

./main.py --startup_comment = "my comment"
