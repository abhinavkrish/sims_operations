Archiving the simulator's root directory: cronos:/data1/simulator
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The NOAO CIS group is responsible for periodic backup of the users' home 
directories on NOAO computer systems. They do NOT backup auxiliary data 
directories.  

The script:  <$LSST>/simulator/extern/SimBackup.py should be used 
periodically to archive the simulator's environment.  Minimally, the backup 
should be initiated soon after any major simulator software update.

At the moment, the backup is orchestrated by hand whenever a new Production
version is released or a major upgrade has been 'cvs committed'.

To use:
    % su
    % cd ..../simulator/extern/
    % ./SimBackup.py
    .....wait a long time....
    % ^D  (i.e. root logout)


The script is marginal, at best.  When the destination disk runs out of space,
the script exits with a failure notification informing you that you need
to free up room on the destination disk.  It's envisioned that the oldest
versions would be removed and then the backups rerun.

There are many refinements possible.  Since a new directory is used for each
invocation, static data is archived over and over.
