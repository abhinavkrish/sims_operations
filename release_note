      By adding a new parameter in Filters.conf

==================================
rTag :
  * rTagging version with all of Michelle's changes

Release Notes for OpSim2.5				Jul.  6, 2011
============================
New feature: Scheduled downtime
  * Added scheduled downtime into the scheduling code, replacing our stopgap
	solution of static downtimes injected into the weather dataset.
  * The timing and duration of scheduled downtimes is now user-settable with
	a configuration file, schedDown.conf.  The default file meets the
	frequency specified by Chuck Claver.
  * Removed old classes that are no longer used, namely NonObsScheduler,
	NonObsHistory, NOB, and Operations.
  * Removed code that creates the weather data with injected scheduled
	downtime.

New feature: Random downtime
  * Added a tool to generate a sequence of random downtimes in the format of
	an OpSim config file. A user can then choose which file to use in a
	given simulation.
  * Created a new downtime table in database, downHist, so NOBHist can be
	deprecated without breaking backwards compatibility with previous
	releases.
  * Scheduled downtime is given precedence in the case of conflicting
	downtime events. Random downtime is allowed to finish the fraction
	of time remaining, if any, after scheduled downtime completes.

New feature: Optimization of cloud and seeing accesses
  * Replaced a database read for every call to get cloudiness and seeing with
	an access to in-core data dictionaries of clouds and seeing for
	the night.
  * The structures are built at the start of night.

Minor changes and bug fixes:
  * Separated system-level seeing degradation components. Only telescope
	component degrades with zenith distance.
  * Fix problem with exclusive block sequence code interacting with reuse
	ranking by proposal code.
  * Corrected assumption that more than one filter will be used by survey.
 	A simulation using just one filter can now be run.
  * Fixed performance problem introduced by reuse ranking by proposal change.
	getSeeing() and getTransparency() were being called for every
	observation instead of every reuseCount observations.

KNOWN Problems:
  * Sometimes when completing a sequence, we try to remove the fieldID of
	the completed sequence from Supernova deep drilling proposal's
	self.tonightTargets[] and find it has already been deleted. Added
	debugging in this release to help track how this is happening.


Release Notes for OpSim2.4				Jun. 16, 2010
============================
New feature: NEO Sweet Spot proposal
  * Added hiatus to next night parameter to turn a proposal off for X nights.
  * Track and report solar elongation of observation.  Observe if within
	limits for NEO Sweet Spot proposals.  Added solar elongation
	parameter.
  * Fast revist times require reuse=1 or reuse=2, which slows simulation past
	useable. Rewrote scheduling to allow each proposal to set its own
	level of reuse so proposals with lengthy or no revisit needs can
	have many observations taken without needing to be reranked.

Minor changes:
  * Local sidereal time should always be postive.
  * Change name of SCP Galactic proposal (south celestial pole).
  * Track and record count of nights with each observation (ObsHistory)
	and in TimeHistory.
  * Code cleanup to remove extra calls and unused code.
  * Bringing NearEarthProp.py to running state with current code base.  It
	has been unused.

Release Notes for OpSim2.3.2				Aug. 14, 2009
============================
Minor changes and bug fixes have been made.
  * Change seeing degradation from telescope/camera from stretch goal to
	design goal and multiply effect by airmass to 3/5ths.
  * Correct 'y' sky brightness in twilight to be the same as 'z'.
  * Reset camera rotator to zero position during a filter change.
  * Add sort to suggested observations list for low airmass, dark sky
	brightness, and fieldID to help with reproducible runs
	(initial commit).
  * Correct error in accessing weather table that kept opsim from using the
	last year of weather data.


Release Notes for OpSim2.3.1				Apr. 22, 2009
============================
Minor changes and bug fixes have been made.
  * Add scheduled downtime to 10-year and 3-year weather datasets,
      creating cloudTololoSD and cloud3yrTololoSD tables respectively.
  * Record OPSIM_VERSION in run log.
  * New Installation Guide.
  * New post-processing tool to calculate filter sky brightness and
      ETC sky brightness.
  * Calculate and store actual airmass at time of observation.
  * Remove sky brightness cache to enforce minimum distance to moon
      limit on observing.
  * Change post-processing movie-making script to create a frame
      every X days and update documentation.
  * Cleanup unneeded configuration saving routines.
  * Add usage string for --startup_comment command-line option to
      main.py.
  * Fix airmass cache to use correct parameters and set to off.
  * Update configuration files to new baseline run (opsim1.29).



Release Notes for OpSim2.3				Jan. 9, 2008
==========================
Only minor changes have been made to the Operations Simulator since the
last release OpSim2.2.

  * Script that dumps sql table and data in a form that allows the table
      to be reconstructed.
  * Run tracking.  Production runs require a description.
  * Enhance precision of time accounting (exposure vs. slew, end of night).
  * Flush sky brightness cache at both twilight/dark time boundaries to
      get crisp switch to or from twilight filters.
  * Account for moon down in filter sky brightness calculations.
  * Account for crawling motion of the dome in azimuth slew model.
  * Tag each run with the code version that generated it
  * Add a backup proposal to make sure telescope always has targets
      to observe.
  * Better tessellation of sky into fields.
  * Account for scheduled downtime by changing the cloud tables.
  * External library updates.
